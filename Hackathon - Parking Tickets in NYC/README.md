**Dataset description**  

The NYC Department of Finance collects data on every parking ticket issued in NYC (~10M per year!). This data is made publicly available to aid in ticket resolution and to guide policymakers.
There are four files, covering Aug 2013-June 2017. The files are roughly organized by fiscal year (July 1 - June 30) with the exception of the initial dataset. The initial dataset also lacks 8 columns that are included in the other three datasets (although be warned that these additional data columns are used sparingly). See the dataset descriptions for exact details. Columns include information about the vehicle ticketed, the ticket issued, location, and time.
  
  
**Business task intro**  

You have been requested to provide a report for a private parking providing company about their possible growth in NYC. Analyze the provided dataset and make conclusions regarding the most popular parking areas and vehicle types, tickets info and seasonality.
